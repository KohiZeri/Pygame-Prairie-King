# Pygame-Prairie-King
A third person wave defense game where the player tries to defend against zombies.

The Journey of The Prairie King, a mini-game developed in an indie game known as Stardew Valley. The game I developed is an easier copy of this game. I drew my inspiration on making most of the mechanics, graphics and soundtrack, but not all. Given our time to work on this project, making more levels and mechanics will be incredibly difficult. The code alone took 21 hours total. Which didn’t take as long as trying to recreate the background, character, bullet, and enemies. 

It’s a fantasy game about a lone cowboy who is in a fantasy world similar to Stardew Valley. As he’s trying his best to defeat every last minion while trying not to get touched by them, he’s also on a quest to save a lovely maiden from their clutches. Sadly I couldn’t recreate their boss and life system, so the enemies you will be facing are his minions only and you only get 1 life ( you can think of it as playing minecraft hardcore.). But in the end, after clearing the waves he is able to save the maiden and in the win background we can witness their happy ending.

The enemies are programmed to follow the user's position and move towards you. To make it easier for the user, the zombies can't go diagonally so timing the shots will be very easy. But, if you mess up your shots, it's game over.

As you can see the kill counter on the top left of the screen. You as the player need to finish 75 of them to complete the game(“level 1”). 

This game is similar to an old arcade game like “Shoot em’ up” not fps (first person shooter). To move you can only go up, down, left and right, unlike fps games you cannot move forward, backwards, and side to side. By holding the key “w” you are able to move up, key “s” move down, key “a” move left, key “d” move right. 

Now the fun part, shooting, to do this we press the key “up”, key “down”, key “left”, and key “right”. 

But to make it even more challenging, I was able to change my program so you must face the direction you want to shoot. For example, if you want to shoot up you must face up and press the key “up”. You must make sure you understand this.

In the end I was happy with this result, I recreated most of the action filled game and soundtracks that I loved while playing and had fun doing it. If you enjoyed this game and presentation I highly suggest getting this game and playing prairie king yourself. The original is even harder, only 1.7% of the community could beat it completely and 0.7% were able to beat it without losing lives.
